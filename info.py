Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large 
as it does when viewed from Earth,
and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.
Despite its proximity to the Sun,
Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – 
that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation,
the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again
 from some parts of the planet's surface.
The same thing happens in reverse at sunset.''' 


Venus_info='''Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. 
It’s one of the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets,
 and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density. 
These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.
Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and 
it’s perpetually shrouded in thick,yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, 
causing a runaway greenhouse effect.It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, 
even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. 
Surface temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit 
(475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to melt lead. 
The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely
 crunched mountains and thousands of large volcanoes.
Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.''' 


Earth_info='''Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, 
and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things.
NASA Telescope Takes 12-Year Time-Lapse Movie of Entire Sky.
While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, 
it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
 Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, 
Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, 
all of which are made of rock and metal.The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old.
 All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. 
However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.” '''


Mars_info=''' ​Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun – 
a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. 
Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, 
polar ice caps, canyons,
extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past.
Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system,
 and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape. ''' 

Jupiter_info='''Jupiter has a long history of
 surprising scientists – 
all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found 
the first moons beyond Earth. 
That discovery changed the way we see the universe.
Fifth in line from the Sun,
 Jupiter is, by far,
 the largest planet in the solar system –
 more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold,
 windy clouds of ammonia and water, 
floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.

is a giant storm bigger than Earth 
that has raged for hundreds of years.'''


Saturn_info=''' Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and 
the second-largest planet in our solar system.
Adorned with thousands of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. 
It is not the only planet to have rings –
made of chunks of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's.
Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.'''

Uranus_info='''Uranus is perhaps the strangest planet in the solar system.
At some point during its history, the ice giant was knocked over,
leaving it spinning on its side. 
More than a dozen rings circle the world, and some 27 moons cling to it. 
The planet’s atmosphere is a collection of hydrogen, helium,
and heavier compounds that exist as ices deep in the frigid Uranian clouds.
But beyond a handful of intriguing facts,
scientists know woefully little about this milky blue world,
which was visited for the first and only time by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986.
That could be about to change.'''


Neptune_info='''Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, 
ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.
More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth,
Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and
the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery.
In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close.
It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.'''


Sun_info='''Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star – 
a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system.
The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy,
life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.
The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. 
The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it.
Its gravity holds the solar system together, 
keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. 
The hottest part of the Sun is its core,
where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius).
The Sun’s activity,
from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, 
influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.'''
