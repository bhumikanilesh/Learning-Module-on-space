# A Python-Based Learning Module on the Depths of Space  

## Project Overview  
This project is an interactive Python-based application designed to delve into the mysteries of space. By combining educational content, interactive games, and simulations, it provides an immersive and engaging way to explore the cosmos.  

The project utilizes powerful Python libraries and engines, such as **Pygame**, **Tkinter**, **Ursina**, and **Subprocesses**, to deliver a unique learning experience.  

## Why This Project Matters  
This project goes beyond being just an interactive tool; itâ€™s a gateway to understanding the vastness of space. Through games, simulations, and quizzes, users can deepen their knowledge of the cosmos in an engaging and informative manner.  

## Features  

### 1. **Introductory Video**  
   - The application starts with an introductory video featuring the project title and breathtaking visuals of significant space events like black hole formation.  

### 2. **Main Tab with Three Sub-functions**  
   - **2.1. Black Hole Growth Game**  
     - A game based on the snake game logic, where a black hole consumes objects and grows in size.  
     - This module introduces users to the concept of black holes and their growth through consumption.  
   - **2.2. Zodiac Sign Teller**  
     - Input your birthday, and the program calculates your zodiac sign.  
     - It aims to spark curiosity about constellations and its connection with space.  
   - **2.3. Space Quiz and 3D Solar System Simulation**  
     - **2.3.1. Planet-Based Quiz**  
       - Click on a planet, and a question related to it appears in a new window.  
       - Encourages users to learn more about planets interactively.  
     - **2.3.2. 3D Solar System Simulation**  
       - Dive deeper into space with a 3D simulation of the solar system, created using the Ursina engine.  
       - Planets and space entities are accurately positioned using mathematical equations.
       - Clicking on planets provides informative details about them, making the simulation not only visually engaging but also highly educational.  
       - The simulation allows users to zoom in and out using the mouse, offering a clear and interactive view of our solar system.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python GUI** (Tkinter) for the user interface.  
- **Pygame** for game mechanics.  
- **Ursina Engine** for creating the 3D solar system simulation.  
- **Subprocess Module** for handling the introductory video and managing external processes.
